1.8.0
- Add handling for observing TLOs that may not be present on all toons
  Relies on defining dependencies between observed properties. For example:
    If you have the MQ2Monk, MQ2Eskay and MQ2Rogue plugins, which add TLO `CWTN`, and you want to observe `CWTN.Mode`, then it may interfere
    with macros running on toons without a CWTN class plugin loaded, like bards.
    This can be handled by defining the observed property as:
```
     { Name='Me.Class.ShortName' },
     { Name='CWTN.Mode', DependsOnName='Me.Class.ShortName', DependsOnValue='MNK,SHD,ROG' }
```
    This will result in the `CWTN.Mode` property only being observed on monks, shadow knights and rogues.
- Set initial window size if window has default 32x32 size.
- Exit if game state is not INGAME.

- Add sorting by columns
- Add PeerSource to allow getting peer list from either dannet or netbots
- Add "FromIDProperty" to spawn properties to allow getting spawn properties
  for something other than botName. The referred property must be a Spawn ID.
  For example:
    NetBots property: {Name='TargetID'}
    Spawn property:   {Name='CleanName',FromIDProperty='TargetID'}
    Then assign a column to display property 'CleanName'
- Move /boxhudanon under new /bhadmin
